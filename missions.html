         <h2>Missions</h2>
         <h3>Balloon Launch System B.L.S.</h3>
         <p>The ultimate goal of this mission is to successfully carry a rocket to the edge of space by a high-altitude balloon-lifted launch apparatus. This underdeveloped method of carrying small satellites and cargo into space will result in drastic cost reductions thereby making space much more accessible to everyone.</p>
         <h4>Phase 1</h4>
         <p>Phase 1 will mark the first flight of the basic launch apparatus design. This will be a scaled down test. The balloon apparatus will be tethered to the ground, the rocket will be a small, solid fueled, low apogee rocket, the balloon array will consist of many small balloons as opposed to future phases in which we hope to use only a few high-altitude weather balloons. The launch apparatus will travel to approximately 500 feet and then the rocket will travel about another 500 feet. The launch mechanisms whereby the rocket engine is ignited will use radio signals from the ground. The radio apparatus will be housed in the instrument module, affixed to the bottom of the launch apparatus, just below the rocket. In future phases, the instrument module will be detached from the apparatus and ejecting a parachute as it falls. This way, the most expensive parts of the apparatus - while comparatively very inexpensive to contemporary rocket launches - will be salvaged and reused.</p>
         <h4>More phases upcoming</h4>
